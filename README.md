Add code to your child theme’s functions.php file or via a plugin that allows custom functions to be added, such as the [snippets plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/) plugin. Avoid adding custom code directly to your parent theme’s functions.php file as this will be wiped entirely when you update the theme.
